                        In Philippine folklore, the aswang is a sinister shapeshifter with traits similar to vampires, werewolves, and ghouls. Since its appearance varies depending on location, there is no single, definitive description. Over time, the term "aswang" has been broadly used to describe most malevolent creatures that lurk in the night, often based on hearsay and evolving regional interpretations.

                        The word "aswang" comes from the Filipino term aso-wang, meaning "dog-like," as these creatures are often said to take the form of dogs. According to historian Professor Anthony Lim, the aswang legend may have social and scientific roots. He suggests that supernatural beliefs, including those surrounding the aswang, were introduced to the Philippines during the Malay migration in the 13th century.

                The aswang isn't just a myth—it's a cultural force that has shaped Filipino fears, traditions, and even history.

                        Despite being a creature of the past, the aswang has never completely faded.

It continues to serve as a symbol of our deep-rooted beliefs, fears, and imagination.
